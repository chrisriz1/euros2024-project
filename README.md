Euros 2024 Soccer Tournament Data Analysis

Description
The purpose of this project was to analyze the performance of teams and players in the UEFA Euros 2024 tournament using various tools and technologies. Additionally, it served as a practical application of the skills I have learned to create my first analytics project.

Technologies Used
- Microsoft Excel
- MySQL
- Adobe Photoshop
- Amazon S3
- Microsoft PowerPoint
- Tableau
- Google Images
- Data Sources
    - Official UEFA website https://www.uefa.com/euro2024/
    - Kaggle public datasets https://www.kaggle.com/

Steps Taken
1. Data Collection: Gathered data from Kaggle and the official UEFA website. From Kaggle, a CSV file containing data about the teams participating in the Euros 2024 tournament was obtained. The official UEFA website provided data on player performance, which was imported into Microsoft Excel.
2. Data Cleaning: Cleaned and pre-processed the CSV file from Kaggle using Microsoft Excel and MySQL.
3. Data Analysis: Analyzed the data to find key insights and determine the focus of the dashboard.
4. Image Collection: Obtained images of country flags and players.
5. Image Photoshopping: Encountered issues with using player images without backgrounds, so I improvised by photoshopping player images onto their respective country flags.
6. Image Upload: Used Amazon S3 to upload the images to a bucket and obtained object links for each individual image.
7. Revision of Excel Files: Revised the "euro_scorers" and "euro_assisters" files to link images with each player by adding an ID in a new sheet.
8. Data Visualization: Connected to MySQL in Tableau and applied custom queries to obtain valuable insights identified in step 3. Uploaded necessary Excel files, such as "euro_scorers" and "euro_assisters," and built all visualizations.
9. PowerPoint: Created a dashboard layout in PowerPoint, which was then used in Tableau to place all visualizations.
10. Revision, Editing, and Formatting: Edited, revised, and formatted the dashboard to ensure it was aesthetically pleasing and professional.
